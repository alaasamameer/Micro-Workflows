Kepler Demos Directory
----------------------

Every effort has been made to ensure that the workflows in this directory 
work properly.  However, some workflows are more experimental than others, 
have very complicated dependencies or may even rely on a distant server.  
These workflows have been tested by the Kepler team to the best of our 
ability, but may still fail upon execution.  They are provided for 
demonstration purposes only.  The ENM workflows are especially prone to 
failure due to the complex natures of the workflows.  If you are 
having problems running a demo workflow, please email 
kepler-users@ecoinformatics.org with your error message and a description 
of the problem.
