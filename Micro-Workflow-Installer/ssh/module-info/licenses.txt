1.  Redistributions of this Software, with or without modification,
    must reproduce the GTPL in: (1) the Software, or (2) the Documentation
    or some other similar material which is provided with the Software
    (if any).

2.  The Documentation, alone or if included with a redistribution of
    the Software, must include the following notice: "This

    a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under such patent
    claims, with the rights to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
